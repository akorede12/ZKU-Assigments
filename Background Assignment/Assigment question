Q1. Program a super simple “Hello World” smart contract: store an unsigned integer and then retrieve it. 
Please clearly comment your code. Once completed, deploy the smart contract on Remix. 
Include the .sol file and a screenshot of the Remix UI once deployed in your final submission pdf (more info about submission formatting below).

Q2. On the documentation page, the “Ballot” contract  demonstrates a lot of features on Solidity. 
Read through the script and try to understand what each line of code is doing, then implement the Possible Improvements by reducing the number of transactions 
in the “giveRightToVote” function while maintaining the same functionality of the program.

Q3. Deploy your script on Remix and compare the difference in gas fees between the original script and the improved script 
when giving 10 voters the right to vote. Once completed, submit (via pdf or Github) 
(1) your improved version of the contract (.sol file) with comments describing the changes you made, and 
(2) screenshots (before and after) of the gas fees for the transaction(s) to give 10 voters the right to vote. 
All code to be submitted either in pdf ( only code snippets where ever required) or via Github links ( copy the repo/pull-request links and the commit in the pdf).
